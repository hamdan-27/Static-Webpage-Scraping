# Static-Webpage-Scraping
## Static web scraping of an online directory of university faculty members.
Python script for scraping an online directory of faculty members of Touro University and storing the data into a csv file. The script only uses BeautifulSoup4 as it is most convenient for static websites like this one. In this case we only scrape the name and email of faculty members.
